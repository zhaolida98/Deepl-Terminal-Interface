# Deepl-Terminal-Interface

Deepl webpage interface has a usage limitation (300,000 words) while its developer API has almost no limitation (500,000 words/mon). 
After using up all free translation words, I have to use service through the APIs. 

Thus, I developed this simple script for daily translation usage on the Linux terminal.
